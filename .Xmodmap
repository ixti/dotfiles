! Most of the time I use Logitech K810 keyboard. Insert key is a secondary role
! of Delete (FN+Del). But on the left side of this butten there's absolutely
! useless key for me: <Print / Scroll_Lock>. I don't need neither of them, so
! replacing them both to be a bit more useful...
!
! ### Original Mapping ###
!
! keycode 78  = Scroll_Lock
! keycode 107 = Print

keycode 78  = Insert
keycode 107 = Insert
