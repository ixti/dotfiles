! Logitech K810 is a pretty awesome keyboard (although i wish i could swap
! FN modifier to switch FN key to be media keys rather than I had to press
! FN in addition to trigger FN key). But the most annoying thing for me is
! absence of Insert key and Print Screen / Screen Lock on place usually insert
! is placed...

! Original mapping:
!
! keycode 78  = Scroll_Lock
! keycode 107 = Print
! keycode 118 = Insert
!

keycode 78  = Print
keycode 107 = Insert
keycode 118 = Insert
