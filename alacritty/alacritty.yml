# env:
#   # TERM variable
#   #
#   # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
#   # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
#   # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
#   # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
#   #
#   # XXX: this variable is set on terminal start, thus it's what it was set at
#   #   the terminal start all the time afterwards, including when running ssh.
#   TERM: xterm-256color
